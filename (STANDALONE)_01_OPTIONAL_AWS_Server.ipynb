    "**About (TL/DR):** The following collection of notebooks introduces developers and data scientists to web development using Flask. Flask is one of many available web server gateway interface (WSGI) tools that enable rapid and scalable websites and apps with a relatively accessible learning curve. The barebones capacity of Flask is particularly valuable when prototyping and iterating upon products, services, and machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goal(s):** Gain an understanding of how to utilize available libraries and packages to quickly build products and services -- in real-life settings, using web-first methodology, driven by data, and end-to-end. In particular, learn how to build a bare-bones flask environment for handling large scale email automation tasks.\n",

    "In order to create a barebones website that communicates with existing API's to generate emails, we will need to connect several components. Specifically, we will to spin up an [**AWS server**](https://aws.amazon.com/) account, create an [**Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance, link our [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) environment to the [**Google Sheets API**](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api), and then send emails using [**smtplib**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html) via either a local or remote server. There are many theoretical and applied topics that underlie the various components of technology stack just mentioned. For the sake of focusing on the implementation, none of the notebooks in this series will deepdive into any of the required components. Intead, the content is purposefully accessible and designed for selflearning with the assumption that the user is familiar with the above concepts. In case you are not yet ready but want to follow along, following are some helpful links to help you with some of the prerequisites.<br>\n",
